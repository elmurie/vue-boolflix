## Info
This is a Netflix clone that shows movies and TV Series using TheMovieDB's API.
Hovering over a card will display the corresponding data. **Intended for Italian speakers only, sorry ** :sweat_smile:
The website grabs the trending movies and TV series from the API on page load, but you can search for your favourite using the search bar.  
Technologies: **VUE CLI**, **Bootstrap**
